## Provider build

I need to build download pdf invoice automation service, I download from a lot of provider, I use strategy pattern to handle download, so you can check some provider that
already provide in @lib/hoadongoc/downloader/ folder to see how to implement it.

I will ask you to implement a provider by the Name of the provider
Then you should ask me:

1. how detectProvider ?
2. which lookupUrl ?
3. how to extract lookupInfo from params ?
4. how to download the invoice ?
   - which cookies should I set ?
   - whichs curls should I use ?

Base on that, you can implement the provider and I will test, if it not work, I will ask you to fix it again.
